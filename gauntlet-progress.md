# Push implementation gauntlet

Goal: implement docs/plan.md, replace empty API contract, create private push-dot/push-fe and push-dot/push-be and attach pinned submodules.

## Locked references and checks

- Product contract: docs/plan.md, retrieved 2026-09-07. Final UI decision supersedes initial right-panel requirement.
- Visual reference: docs/no-right-sidebar-prototype-v6.png (1672×941), inspected. Historical Aside captures are missing; no claim of comparison to those captures.
- Domain reference: docs/plan.md and docs/api.md only. Fresh implementation; user forbids legacy/Super Resume code references.
- Comparison mode: champion/challenger against product specification (cross-medium); UI compares rendered candidates against prototype. Each critic receives neutral immutable candidate versions and version-matched checks, never this progress file.
- Acceptance: evidence lineage; two-job isolation; fabricated claims blocked at finalization; PDF/DOCX Korean text, pagination and links; OAuth return and expiration; offline editing/conflicts; webhook idempotency; CLI absent/denied/failure/verified; no unapproved application submission; secrets absent from logs; keyboard/dark/narrow UI; actual beta 16/20 successful journeys.
- Tools: Codex collaboration spawn_agent, fresh critics via fork_turns=none; inherited model settings. FE and BE parallel after API publication, as explicitly requested; only lead spawns. No background automation.

## Tasks

1. Fresh domain implementation and server API — implemented;30 real PostgreSQL tests pass.
2. Tauri desktop shell and company chats without right sidebar — local execution/visual comparison pass.
3. Vault, analysis, editor, immutable versions and PDF/DOCX — local API/UI/export checks pass.
4. Pipeline, calendar, interviews and offers — implemented; company-source and rejection UI/API verification pass.
5. Four blueprints and approved external CLI execution/evidence verification — local subprocess and provider-boundary checks pass.
6. OAuth, Google, AI/BYOK, billing, flagged job adapters — implemented; actual external account verification pending readiness.
7. Release signing/notarization/updater and20-person private beta — local Universal app/DMG ready; external credentials/participants pending.
8. Integrated acceptance and fresh critic convergence — scoped visual/storage/native/billing checks pass; company research and durable ACK coverage checks pass.
9. Commit units, PRs to develop, squash merge and pin submodules — PRs created, BE squash merged; FE platformCI and root final integration pending.

## Repository state

Original untracked docs preserved at /Volumes/Untitled/Documents/Github/push-workspace/docs.
Isolated implementation: /Volumes/Untitled/Documents/Github/push-workspace-implementation, feat/implement-push-plan based on develop.
Private repositories created: https://github.com/push-dot/push-fe and https://github.com/push-dot/push-be.
No existing executable code or test suite; baseline consists of README and untracked user docs.

## Evidence and next action

Initial API, server and frontend checkpoints have passed scoped checks recorded below. Full gauntlet convergence remains pending. External integrations must fail closed when credentials/permissions are absent; never label mocks as live integrations.

2026-09-07 user steering: external VPS/OAuth/Stripe/Apple/beta not prepared; proceed with implementation and local verification. External launch criteria stay explicitly pending, not a reason to stop local work.
Backend builder agent: /root/backend_builder, owns push-be. Lead owns docs/api.md. Running actual PostgreSQL on 127.0.0.1:55432/push_test for integration tests.

2026-09-07 user steering: React HTTP MUST use ky; FSD structure with explicitly invoked feature-sliced-design skill. Loaded /Users/cyjoon/.agents/skills/feature-sliced-design/SKILL.md and layer/framework references. FSD v2.1 pages-first, index public APIs, no same-layer slice imports; no speculative layers. Frontend task must enforce this and test request auth/errors/no mutation retries.
2026-09-07 user steering: state management MUST use Zustand (쥬스턴드). Required FE stack: React + ky + Zustand + FSD v2.1, Tauri v2, SQLite, TipTap. Place stores at owning layer; no app-store upward imports from pages.
2026-09-07 user explicitly authorized FE/BE parallel after API doc. Initial contract exists; overrides sequential implementer rule. Spawned /root/frontend_builder owning push-fe, while /root/backend_builder owns push-be; lead owns docs/api.md. Shared interface changes coordinated between builders. Lead owns root files, integration tests, immutable comparisons.

Backend candidate checkpoint e7a80fe saved immutably in .artifacts/backend-a. Lead independently ran TEST_DATABASE_URL=local PostgreSQL go test -race -count=1 ./... on that snapshot: PASS (1.675s). This establishes phase-1 tests only, not complete server/runtime or external integration success. Next: full executable + auth/billing tests and challenger snapshot.

Priority correction from user: API must be written in original workspace docs/api.md FIRST; fresh development, no existing-code/Super Resume references. Both builders paused while lead authored full contract and then resumed parallel. Original API document is now present and mirrored to implementation worktree. User requests highest code quality; no lower quality gate.
API preliminary independent check found 8 blocking ambiguities; repaired all in authoritative document. Fresh critic /root/api_spec_critic compared immutable docs: A=revised contract, B=earlier contract; verdict A, gap native launch/recovery reporting absent. Added explicit launch/recover DTO and device-bound state transitions. API docs still design, not claims of implemented routes.

Authoritative API now includes async 202 full Operation in data (poll data.id), explicit source-excerpt ai:null document generation, and exact native launch/recovery reporting. Both builders notified. FE reports 4 tests green (not yet independently verified); first runnable UI pending. Lead rewrote scripts/smoke.mjs against authoritative contract; node syntax check passes, live execution pending contract-ready server. API original file is visible at /Volumes/Untitled/Documents/Github/push-workspace/docs/api.md.

Live API smoke PASS run 4172f759-0677-4e34-ab61-13f431e3ffd5 against immutable binary .artifacts/runtime/push-api-next; exact binary/script hashes and scope in .artifacts/runtime/smoke.json. Auth, idempotency, evidence, unsupported claims, revision conflict, application isolation, submission draft approval, 4 blueprints, 3 CLI denials, Google flag checked over HTTP. Not complete frontend/native/provider evidence.

Frontend immutable checkpoint .artifacts/frontend-a: production build and 8 tests passed. Real browser at 1672×941, API connected: evidence creation, job/application creation, scoped evidence approval, React/TypeScript analysis and source-excerpt document v1 saved successfully. Approval review currently lacks human-readable payload and was returned to FE for correction. Browser journey continuing; no final visual/accessibility/export pass claimed. Native builder reports 8 Rust checks; independent build/runtime verification pending.

Second immutable backend acb52d8: lead go test -race PASS (1.686s), expanded live smoke PASS 3af5acbc-d64d-405f-8765-5c4ed8ba4a0e including interview evidence, calendar link, cross-currency offer comparison, routine confirmation. Exact hashes in .artifacts/runtime/smoke-b.json. Immutable FE 0414fe0 build/FSD/10 tests PASS, but PDF raster inspection found missing glyphs despite text extraction passing. Returned font embedding defect to builder; no PDF visual pass yet.

Independent FE critic comparison A=e1ec421 vs B=0414fe0 chose A but retained blockers: actual delayed save/load erases newer edits, Asia/Seoul calendar month bounds wrong. FE assigned fixes plus remaining pin/NEEDS_INPUT/offline memo/calendar features. Root e1ec421 immutable build/FSD/12 tests pass. PDF raster now visibly correct. DOCX rendered via bundled LibreOffice using task-local FONTCONFIG_FILE with licensed NanumGothic: Korean and links visibly correct; font embedding portability improvement assigned.
Independent BE/native critic A98b5461 vs Bacb52d8 chose A with blockers: native result missing commitSha, server-start/local-claim crash dead end, Gemini missing grounded prompt, AI worker restart recovery absent. Builders assigned corrections; not a convergence verdict. Root backend98b5461 race tests/vet pass. Actual Tauri0219d1e shell launched, duplicated titlebar fixed, maximize/restore observed. Universal build/signing and remaining interactions not yet certified.

Root immutable FE4ec3b7e: build/FSD19 unit+export tests PASS,3 actual API tests PASS against both acb52d8 and a68a139 (export/import resume/sync+pins).

New FE critic A4ec3b7e vsBe1ec421 choseA but actual handler reproduction found document-switch Acontent→Bsave contamination while Bload pending; builder reproduced with realReact component and is repairing. Native critic A02730a8 vsB0219d1e choseA but rejected-start PREPARED retry and directory replacement before spawn remain; builder repairing. No convergence claimed.
